    <h2>Customize your hood</h2>
    Kibicara provides the technology for hood admins to connect people over

    <h2>Share the information</h2>
    Hood admins share the platform-specific broadcasting endpoints with their
    community and provide the information and technology to its members. This is
    done by providing a <a [routerLink]="['/hoods']">public hood page</a>.
