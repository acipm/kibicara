        <mat-panel-title>What is a Kibicara hood?</mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        Kibicara hoods are community-administrated instances of Kibicara. A hood
        can be imagined as a box that takes messages from different messaging
        platforms and distributes it to other messaging platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        You as a hood user can join a hood by searching for its public hood
        page. There you will find the information on how to subscribe to this
        hood from your favourite platform. Additionally the public hood page
        provides information on how to send broadcast messages to the hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kibicara hoods are thought to represent a community that exists in real
        life. This means for example a neighborhood community that wants to use
        technology to communicate but has people who only can use specific
        technology and don't want to be excluded (e.g. people who only have
        email).

        <mat-panel-title>What is a public hood page?</mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        A public hood page provides you with the information about your hood.
        This includes how to join, receive messages and send messages. Usually
        you receive a link to the hood page of your community, but you can also
        use the <a [routerLink]="['/hoods']">search</a> to find your hood page.

        <mat-panel-title>What is a hood admin?</mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        A hood admin is a person from your community who configures your
        Kibicara hood for you to use. They give you a proper introduction and
        usually send you the link to your hood page. They take care of the
        social networking and the technology to use.

        <mat-panel-title>Are my messages anonymous?</mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        No, your messages are not generally sent anonymously. Depending on the
        platform you use, you can get away with being pseudonymous. We don't
        send your user name, but the terms of the platform you use to send the
        message still applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also: Everyone on the Internet can read the content of your messages. We
        disadvice to send sensitive data since everyone on the Internet can read
        it. The use case of hoods is broadcasting public messages!

      <p>
        The Kibicara server does save different information depending on the
        use. If you are a normal user:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Twitter: We save the id of the last received message (mentions and
          direct messages). This can be a message of yours if you sent the
          latest message.
        </li>
        <li>Telegram: We save your telegram username.</li>
        <li>E-Mail: We save your e-mail address.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We don't save any messages sent. Still every of your message will be
        broadcasted to different platforms, so these platforms of course save
        the content of your message. We disadvice to send sensitive data since
        everyone on the Internet can read it. The use case of hoods is
        broadcasting public messages.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>We save your e-mail address and your password.</li>
        <li>

          to the twitter account and the username of the twitter account. We
          disadvice the use of your private twitter account for acting as
          Kibicara platform bot. Please create a new twitter account.
