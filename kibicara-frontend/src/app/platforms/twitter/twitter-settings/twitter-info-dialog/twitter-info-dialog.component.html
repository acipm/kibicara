  <h2>How to add a twitter bot to your hood</h2>
  <h3>What is a twitter bot?</h3>
  <p>
    Twitter bots are twitter accounts operated by software. In our case, we
    will show you how to add a bot for users to subscribe to, so they can send
    messages to your hood by mentioning the bot or direct messaging it. The
    message then get distributed to the other platforms. Additionally, they can
    receive messages from other platforms by reading the tweets of the bot.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example: </strong> You as a hood admin added the bot
    @kibicara-my-hood to your hood. John wants to send a message to all hood
    subscribers. He then uses his twitter account to follow the bot
    @kibicara-my-hood and sends his message to the bot by sending a tweet
    mentioning it. His message will be distributed to the other platforms
    and Sandra, who is a hood member and subscribed to your email bot, gets
    John's message via email.

  <h3>How can I add a twitter bot to my hood?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Create a twitter account</a>
      for the twitter bot and log in. We <strong>DON'T</strong> recommend using
      your own personal twitter account but to create a new seperate hood
      account since you will give full access to the account to our software.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click on the <strong>Add a new platform connection!</strong> button. This
      will redirect you to the twitter page to authorize access to the twitter
      account. Then, click the <strong>Authorize app</strong> button. You will
      be redirected back here. Done!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Can I stop a bot from relaying messages?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. If you want a bot to stop relaying messages, deactivate it by toggling
    the switch next to the bot. Press the switch again to reenable the bot.
