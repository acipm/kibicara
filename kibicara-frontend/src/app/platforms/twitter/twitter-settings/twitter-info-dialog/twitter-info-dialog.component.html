  <h2>How to add an twitter bot to your hood</h2>
  <h3>What is a twitter bot?</h3>
  <p>
    Twitter bots are twitter accounts operated by software. In our case we will
    show you how to add a bot for users to subscribe to, so they can send
    messages into your hood system by mentioning the bot or direct messaging it,
    which get distributed to the other platforms. Also they can receive messages
    from other platforms by reading the tweets of the bot.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example: </strong> You as a hood admin added the bot
    @kibicara-my-hood to your hood. John wants to send a message to all hood
    subscribers. He then uses his twitter account to follow to the bot
    @kibicara-my-hood and sends his message to the bot by sending a tweet. His
    message will be distributed to the other platforms and Sandra who is
    subscribed to your email hood bot gets John's message via email.

    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Create a twitter account</a>
      for the twitter bot and log in. We recommend <strong>NOT</strong> to use
      your own personal twitter account but to create a new seperate hood
      account since you will give full access to the account to our software.

      will redirect you to the twitter page to authorize access to the twitter
      account. Click the
