  <h2>How to add an inbox address to your hood</h2>
  <h3>What is a hood inbox?</h3>
  <p>
    A hood inbox is an email address where users can send an email to. This
    email gets thrown into the hood system and distributed to other platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example: </strong> You as a hood admin added the inbox
    "kibicara-my-hood-inbox" to your hood. John wants to send a message to all
    hood subscribers. He then uses his normal email program to send his message
    to "kibicara-my-hood-inbox@{{ domain }}". His message will be distributed to
    the other platforms and Sandra who is subscribed to your telegram hood bot
    gets John's message.
