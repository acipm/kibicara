  <h2>How to add an telegram bot to your hood</h2>
  <h3>What is a telegram bot?</h3>
  <p>
    Telegram bots are Telegram accounts operated by software. In our case we
    will show you how to add a bot for users to subscribe to, so they can send
    messages into your hood system, which get distributed to the other
    platforms. Also they can receive messages from other platforms
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example: </strong> You as a hood admin added the bot
    @kibicara-my-hood to your hood. John wants to send a message to all hood
    subscribers. He then uses his telegram account to subscribe to the bot
    @kibicara-my-hood and sends his message to the bot. His message will be
    distributed to the other platforms and Sandra who is subscribed to your
    email hood bot gets John's message via email.
